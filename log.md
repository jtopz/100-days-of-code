### Day 1: Jan 25, Fri

**Today's Progress**: Started an udemy course by Hesham Emara where i learnt how to turn a normal photoshop design into a cool layout in the browser by creating a Modern YouTube Homepage From Scratch Using HTML5, CSS3 & JQuery. Also went back to freecodecamp to continue from where i stopped. 

**Thoughts** overall i learnt how to turn psd into code and get hands-on with useful jQuery stuffs. My goal also is to get all certificates from FCC.
